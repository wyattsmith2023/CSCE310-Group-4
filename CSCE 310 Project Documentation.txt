Search
- Tutors must have at least one subject and class to appear in seach
	- Otherwise, tutor profile is considered incomplete and is not displayed
- Can search by
	- Class Code 	Ex: CSCE
	- Class Number 	Ex: 310
	- Subject		Ex: Science

Subject, Class, Tag
- Elements can be added multiple times with different IDs
- Done to permit easier deletion without breaking foreign key constraints

Users: Is_Student, Is_Tutor, Is_Admin
- These fields cannot be edited
- Instead an admin must create a new user

Appointment Constraints
- Elements such as subjects and availabilities have limited deletion due to foreign key constraint
	- Done to protect appointments from losing data or being deleted without users realizing
- Tutors and Students can only Add and Delete to prevent confusion involving Edits

Expectations of Users
- Students have access to Tutor contacts and are expected to shcedule an appointment and then contact a tutor.
- Tutors wait to be contacted by a student
